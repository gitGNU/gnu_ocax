OCAx. Citizens' observatroy software
------------------------------------

OCAx is a web application written in PHP/MySQL using the Yii (version 1) framework.

It is designed as a citizens' audit tool. It is already being used to audit local town council administrations but could also be used to audit and observe any public administration.


For example, a group of people from any town can use OCAx to visualize municipal budgets and promote the investigation (audit) of the council by all townspeople via enquiries and replies in a transparent fashion.
OCAx is focused on empowering citizens.

We understand that a citizens' audit creates a collective knowledge that belongs to the people and we are building software to help people to make grow and maintain that knowledge over the years.

Unlike other software we've been able to find, OCAx marries budgets, suplementary budget information, and enquiries (with their corresponding replies) publicly.
